# Health Care Service Delivery Quality in Sub-Saharan Africa
**Findings from the Service Delivery Indicators Health Surveys Clinical Vignettes 2010-2016**

The set of do-files provided here does the following:
- Uses item response theory to generate a set of "knowledge" scores for all healthcare providers in the sample.
- Creates a set of variables that measure provider effort, knowledge, and performance on clinical vignettes. These variables include measures of correct diagnosis and treatment, among others.
- Generates item response curves for each diagnostic item included in the item response theory algorithm.
- Produces figures that compare provider knowledge and performance across and within countries to populate presentations of the cross-country comparison and individual country profiles.

This material also includes the references used to determine whether providers correctly treated the conditions in the vignettes. In addition, the resulting cross-country comparison and country profiles are available in the "outputs/presentations" folder.

The analysis relies on data available here: [https://github.com/worldbank/SDI-Health](https://github.com/worldbank/SDI-Health)
